    <p class="description">
        Katara is one of the main characters in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender">Nickelodean TV Show Avatar</a> the Last Airbender. Throughout the show, Katara's character grows, as she starts the show with minimal powers and insecurity in being the sole female water bender in her tribe to mastering the coordination and precision it takes use water for her advantage. As each season progresses, Katara continues on taking a leadership role within the friend group, taking on more and more difficult missions while honing her water bending skills.

    <h2>Some of the reasons I admire Katara:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>She doesn't let others define her abilities and capabilities.</li>
        <li>She's willing to, and will, speak her opinion no matter the situation.</li>
        <li class="listitem">Her hair.</li>
    </ul>
